# Analysis code for the sea ice components of ARCTEX Work Package 1
## Advanced EO research: Novel Product Development and Validation

Code is currently split into four main directories:
> ice_cover
> > Analysing the fractional cover of sea ice within a given radius, and producing an _open water index_ for each year at Flade and Austfonna

> ice_edge
> > Analysing the position of the _ice edge centre of mass_ around Svalbard

> melange
> > Investigating the melange properties of Victoria fjord around the terminus of C.H. Ostenfeld glacier in Northern Greenland

> weather
> > Analysing CARRA-West data to link sea ice behaviour with glaciological evolution

Most of this code analyses output from other routines that run on the UiT RCM3 server. I haven't yet frozen the environment for this yet, but will upload a .yml file when I do so. The server routines will be published alongside another .yml file (since the version of python on there is older).
